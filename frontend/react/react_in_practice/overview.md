# Introduction to series of practical examplse with react

All source code in this series is stored in [react_memos](https://github.com/vavilov2212/react_memos) repository, each in its relative subdirectory.

This is a showcase of some "best practices" or simply thing, that i want to remember, from my day-to-day development practice. Each subdirectory in this repository has corresponding article describing the problem and solution. Link to each article and a short TL;DR; is given in the README file.
