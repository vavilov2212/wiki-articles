# This page exists solely to refer to

[https://usehooks.com/](https://usehooks.com/) - The name says it all. This page has lots of examples of hooks and many axamples in this wikis category are from there.

For instance [useAsync](https://usehooks.com/useAsync/) is great hook to fetch remote data.

> An example would be fetching data from an API and displaying a loading indicator before rendering the results. Another example would be a form where you want to disable the submit button when the submission is pending and then display either a success or error message when it completes. 

More robust solution would be to [useSWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) hook.

> The name “SWR” is derived from stale-while-revalidate, a HTTP cache invalidation strategy popularized by HTTP RFC 5861. SWR is a strategy to first return the data from cache (stale), then send the fetch request (revalidate), and finally come with the up-to-date data.
