## Dotfiles configuration

There should be an easier way to manage dofiles, than just keeping them in a repo.

## [Dotbot](./dotbot.md)

Lets you symlink files & filders from your personal repo to desired path on the system.

Pros:
- comprehensive documentation
- easy to use (clone & run ./install)
- easy to config (json | yaml)
- with additional configuration lets you install different profiles with different configurations

Cons:
- Need to figure out how to tailor zsh plugins (oh-my-zsh, etc.)


## Other options

- [yadm](https://yadm.io/docs/overview#)
- [modules.sourceforge.net](http://modules.sourceforge.net) -  The Environment Modules package provides for the dynamic modification of a user's environment via modulefiles.
