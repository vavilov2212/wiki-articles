# Creating markup for eon-block-explorer

 `nextjs/tailwind`

## Custom CSS in tailwind

Tailwind groups styles into @layers as in the concept of [ITCSS *Inverted Triangle CSS*](https://www.xfive.co/blog/itcss-scalable-maintainable-css-architecture/#what-is-itcss).
You add this in the root styles file e.g. `styles/global.css`

Now if you want to add fonts, it's better to keep their declarations in a separate file. Now you can @import (postCss syntax) in your main file. Use @layer directive to override or add to tailwind base layer.

 ```CSS
// styles/global.css

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@layer base {
  @import './fonts.css';
}
 ```
