# Declaration file in typeScript

TypeSctipt has a unique file extencion `.d.ts` which is used by the compiler. I'm used to putting it in a separate folder `typings` in the root of the project. In this case it's neccesary to add `typings` to `include` section of tscfig.json.

```JSON
{
  ... // other config options
  "include": ["next-env.d.ts", "**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx", "typings/*.d.ts"],
}
```

A `.d.ts` file is where typed declarations are added. For instance, if you have a javaScript module which is not typed - you can write the following:

```JSON
// index.d.ts

declate module 'my-module-without-types'; // will have type `any`
// OR
declare module 'my-module-without-types' {
  exportedPropery1: string;
  exportedPropery2: number;
  ... etc.
}
```
